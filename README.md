The Delta Portfolio

The aim of this project is to build a Christian Faith Based Portfolio. For the benefit of the whole humanity, but primarily for the Christian Catholics of the Bible of Jerusalem, in his version
of 1955 from "Les Editions du Cerf". The Delta Portfolio should be the first and the most advanced portfolio and piece of technology in the world.
The Portfolio should be allowed to apply some many Christian faith based rules and commandments, and so on. For exemple :

1. The Golden Rule (to not do to the others what we wouldn't like them to do to us.
2. Submit to Jésus-Christ the powers, principalities, dominations, etc ...
3. Free slaves and save people
4. To give to others what we would like them to give to us
5. To clarify the truth, the way and life
6. To beautify the world and search love
